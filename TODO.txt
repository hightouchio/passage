- Re-enable authentication for normal tunnels
- Should detect when a tunnel is removed
- Make sure host-key-file is being properly set via ECS
- Try to find a way to make the client blind to whether its a normal or reverse proxy. It shouldn't matter.
- Encrypt private keys.
- Datadog integration
- Better logging

## DONE
- Re-enable authentication checking for reverse tunnels
