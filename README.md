Secure private tunnels as a service üîê

## Get Started
```bash 
$ docker compose up
$ curl -X POST -d '{"sshHost":"localhost"}' http://localhost:6000/api/tunnel/standard  
```

passage is primarily started through the subcommand `passage server`.
```
Usage:
  passage server [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for server
```

## What is passage?
passage is a service for programmatically creating and managing SSH tunnels. The primary use case is to serve as a secure bridge between SaaS providers and services that need to be accessed within customer networks. Passage acts both as a management API, and as a daemon which maintains the tunnels themselves. 

### Standard vs Reverse
With **Standard** tunnels, Passage acts as an SSH client, opening an SSH connection to an internet-facing remote bastion server, then from there opening an upstream connection to a private service within the remote network.

With **Reverse** tunnels, Passage acts as an SSH server, allowing remote clients to forward a local port from a hidden server to a dedicated port on the Passage instance, therefore achieving a tunnel without requiring a remote bastion server to be exposed to inbound traffic from the internet.

## Dependencies
- Postgres 11 or later ([`schema`](`sql/1-schema.sql`))
- A keystore to securely store and retrieve public and private keys.
  - Passage supports Postgres or S3 (default is a table in the same Postgres database)
  - Passage does not handle encryption of keys at rest.

## Configuration
Passage can read its configuration from disk (YAML or JSON), or from environment variables.
Passage's config keys are paths in a configuration object, so the dot notation is used to indicate hierarchy.

To use environment variables, replace the dot with an underscore and prefix the variable with `PASSAGE_`.
For example, `tunnel.standard.ssh_user` becomes `PASSAGE_TUNNEL_STANDARD_SSH_USER`.

The following are required config options that you must set to quickstart with Passage. A full configuration reference is available at [docs/config.md](docs/config.md).
